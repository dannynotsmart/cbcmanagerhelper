# Tightrope

## Demo video: https://youtu.be/LvkTyf1HEsQ

Ideas are the currency of the modern world. Without implementing those ideas, we may as well be doomed with respect to the plethora of problems facing us today.

**Tightrope** helps you identify critical contributors without whom important aspects of your project will go unmaintained, as well as providing recommendations on how to increase the resilience of your codebase when team makeup changes.
Practical applications include:
- Identifying members of your team who are the only people knowledgeable about a particular part of your codebase
- Identifying who has worked on similar projects in the past to form a team for a new project
- Determining people to reach out to when trying to learn a part of your codebase.
